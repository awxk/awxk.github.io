# Guess the number game

A simple guessing game where the user tries to guess the secret number between 1 and 100. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To play the game, simply enter your guess in the input field and click the "Submit" button. The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.

The game was created as an example for a tutorial on hosting interactive games using GitHub Pages. Feel free to use the code as a starting point for your own games and projects.
